## Me    

Hi! I am Juan Manuel. Proudly made in San Juan, Argentina.      

I am also a proud [Fulbrighter](https://eca.state.gov/fulbright). I came to the US through the Fulbright Program and received a M.Sc. in Applied Statistics from Loyola University Chicago. Previously in Argentina, I received a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Universidad Nacional de San Juan.    

I am interested in Statistics and in open source software. I'm a Linux newbie and these days I'm trying to abandon Google/Microsoft/Facebook services. For the moment, [twitter](https://twitter.com/canovasjm) is OK.

There is more information about me in my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/canovasjm/
