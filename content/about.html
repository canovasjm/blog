<h2>Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Juan Manuel. Proudly made in San Juan, Argentina.</p>
<p>I am also a proud <a href="https://eca.state.gov/fulbright">Fulbrighter</a>. I came to the US through the Fulbright Program and received a M.Sc. in Applied Statistics from Loyola University Chicago. Previously in Argentina, I received a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Universidad Nacional de San Juan.</p>
<p>I am interested in Statistics in general, but I feel a special attraction to time series. On these days, I am in the transition from Windows to Linux.</p>
<p>There is more information about me in my LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmcanovas/" class="uri">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmcanovas/</a></p>
