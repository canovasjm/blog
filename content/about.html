<h2>Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Juan Manuel. Proudly made in San Juan, Argentina.</p>
<p>I am also a proud <a href="https://eca.state.gov/fulbright">Fulbrighter</a>. I came to the US through the Fulbright Program and received a M.Sc. in Applied Statistics from Loyola University Chicago. Previously in Argentina, I received a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Universidad Nacional de San Juan.</p>
<p>I am interested in Statistics and in open source software. I’m a Linux newbie and these days I’m trying to abandon Google/Microsoft/Facebook services. For the moment, <a href="https://twitter.com/canovasjm">twitter</a> is OK.</p>
<p>There is more information about me in my LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/canovasjm/" class="uri">https://www.linkedin.com/in/canovasjm/</a></p>
