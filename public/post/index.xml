      <description>This is part 2 of the migration from Windows to Linux. Here I will focus on the steps I followed to get Linux running on this Lenovo IdeaPad U410. Briefly speaking, the steps boil down to:
Make (several) back up(s) of the data you wish to keep
 Update Windows
 Update BIOS version
 Disable UEFI
 Create a bootable USB stick with your favourite distro
 Install Linux  NOTE: We will not cover how to set up dual boot (keep Windows and Linux in the same computer and decide which OS you wish to boot into).</description>

      <description>Hi again! This is the first of a series of posts related to my recent journey from Windows to Linux. This first post will cover the reasons why I decided to migrate to Linux and further posts will explain the process. I also want to state beforehand that this post will be highly bias against Windows. Continue reading to see why. Let’s get started.
Some history I bought this Lenovo IdeaPad U410 in January 2013 and spent US$729.</description>

This post is a modification of the final project I did for my Time Series class and the idea is simple: fit an ARIMA model and make a forecast.</description>

      <title>When does the F-test reduce to a t-test?</title>

      <description>If you have taken a regression or design of experiments class (or both), you probably have come across the following problem (or a similar one):
“Show that the sum-of-squares decomposition and F-statistic reduces to the usual equal-variance (pooled) two sample t-test in the case of \(a = 2\) treatments - with the realization that an \(F\) statistic with \(1\) (numerator) and \(k\) (denominator) degrees of freedom is equivalent to a \(t\) statistic with \(k\) degrees of freedom, viz, \(F_{1, k} = t_{k}^2\)”</description>
