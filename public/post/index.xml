      <description>Hi there! This post is a modification of the final project I did for my Time Series class and the idea is simple: fit an ARIMA model and make a forecast. To do so in R we can use auto.arima() from forecast package, or we can decide what model are we going to fit and why. We will choose the latter path :)
Here we are going to explore how the number of domestic air passengers in Argentina has evolved in the last years, fit a model to the data, and forecast the number of domestic passengers for the next twelve months.</description>

      <description>If you have taken a regression or design of experiments class (or both), you probably have come across the following problem (or a similar one):
“Show that the sum-of-squares decomposition and F-statistic reduces to the usual equal-variance (pooled) two sample t-test in the case of \(a = 2\) treatments - with the realization that an \(F\) statistic with \(1\) (numerator) and \(k\) (denominator) degrees of freedom is equivalent to a \(t\) statistic with \(k\) degrees of freedom, viz, \(F_{1, k} = t_{k}^2\)”</description>
