      <description>This is part 2 of the migration from Windows to Linux. Here I will focus on the steps I followed to get Linux running on this Lenovo IdeaPad U410. Briefly speaking, the steps boil down to:
1) Make (several) back up(s) of the data you wish to keep
2) Update Windows
3) Update BIOS version
4) Disable UEFI
5) Create a bootable USB stick with your favourite distro
6) Install Linux</description>

      <description>Hi again! This is the first of a series of posts related to my recent journey from Windows to Linux. This first post will cover the reasons why I decided to migrate to Linux and further posts will explain the process. I also want to state beforehand that this post will be highly bias against Windows. Continue reading to see why. Let’s get started.
Some history I bought this Lenovo IdeaPad U410 in January 2013 and spent US$729.</description>

      <title>ARIMA from scratch</title>

      <description>Hi there! This post is a modification of the final project I did for my Time Series class and the idea is simple: fit an ARIMA model and make a forecast. To do so in R we can use auto.arima() function from forecast package or we can decide what model are we going to fit and why. We will choose the latter path :)
Here we are going to explore how the number of domestic air passengers in Argentina has evolved in the last years, fit a model to the data, and forecast the number of domestic passengers for the next twelve months.</description>

      <title>When does the F-test reduce to a t-test?</title>

      <description>If you have taken a regression or design of experiments class (or both), you probably have come across the following problem (or a similar one):
“Show that the sum-of-squares decomposition and F-statistic reduces to the usual equal-variance (pooled) two sample t-test in the case of \(a = 2\) treatments - with the realization that an \(F\) statistic with \(1\) (numerator) and \(k\) (denominator) degrees of freedom is equivalent to a \(t\) statistic with \(k\) degrees of freedom, viz, \(F_{1, k} = t_{k}^2\)”</description>
