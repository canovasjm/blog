      <description>Hi there! This post is a modification of the final project I did for my Time Series class and the idea is simple: fit an ARIMA model and make a forecast. To do so in R we can use auto.arima() function from forecast package, or we can decide what model are we going to fit and why. We will choose the latter path :)
Here we are going to explore how the number of domestic air passengers in Argentina has evolved in the last years, fit a model to the data, and forecast the number of domestic passengers for the next twelve months.</description>

      <description>If you have taken a regression or design of experiments class (or both), you probably have come across the following problem (or a similar one):
“Show that the sum-of-squares decomposition and F-statistic reduces to the usual equal-variance (pooled) two sample t-test in the case of \(a = 2\) treatments - with the realization that an \(F\) statistic with \(1\) (numerator) and \(k\) (denominator) degrees of freedom is equivalent to a \(t\) statistic with \(k\) degrees of freedom, viz, \(F_{1, k} = t_{k}^2\)”</description>

      <description>MeHi! I am Juan Manuel. Proudly made in San Juan, Argentina.
I am also a proud Fulbrighter. I came to the US through the Fulbright Program and received a M.Sc. in Applied Statistics from Loyola University Chicago. Previously in Argentina, I received a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from Universidad Nacional de San Juan.
I am interested in Statistics in general, but I feel a special attraction to time series. These days I am in the transition from Windows to Linux.</description>
