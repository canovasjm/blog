      <description>If you have taken a regression or design of experiments class (or both), you probably have come across the following problem (or a similar one):
“Show that the sum-of-squares decomposition and F-statistic reduces to the usual equal-variance (pooled) two sample t-test in the case of \(a = 2\) treatments - with the realization that an \(F\) statistic with \(1\) (numerator) and \(k\) (denominator) degrees of freedom is equivalent to a \(t\) statistic with \(k\) degrees of freedom, viz, \(F_{1, k} = t_{k}^2\)”</description>

      <description>Here are links to some of my projects, homeworks, exams, etc. As time permits I will start editing some of them in order to be true blog posts, but for the moment they are not.
